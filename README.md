üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The project uses a modern, decoupled architecture. The backend and frontend are separate applications, and the database is a managed service.

Frontend: A static website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The code for the frontend is located in a separate repository.

Deployment: Deployed as a Static Site on Render.

Backend: A RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework.

Deployment: Deployed as a Web Service on Render, running on a Gunicorn server.

Database: A PostgreSQL database to store all portfolio data.

Deployment: Deployed as a managed PostgreSQL instance on Render.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Local Development
Prerequisites:

Python 3.10+

PostgreSQL

Git

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Ary778/me-api-playground.git
cd me-api-playground
Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project root and add your local database credentials and a secret key:

Code snippet

SECRET_KEY='your-strong-secret-key'
DB_NAME='your_db_name'
DB_USER='your_db_user'
DB_PASSWORD='your_db_password'
Run Database Migrations:

Bash

python manage.py migrate
Run the development server:

Bash

python manage.py runserver
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Production (Render)
Deployment is automated via Render. The render.yaml file and the build.sh script in the repository handle the entire process. Key steps include:

Installing dependencies from requirements.txt.

Running collectstatic to gather all static files.

Running migrate to apply database schema changes.

Starting the server with the gunicorn core.wsgi command.

Environment variables like DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY are configured securely in the Render dashboard.

üìü API Usage (cURL Examples)
Here are a few examples of how to interact with the API.

Get Profile Information

For Individual Profile Information

Bash 

curl https://me-api-backend-ie05.onrender.com/api/profile/[id]/

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
No Authentication: All API endpoints are public and do not require authentication. This is intentional for a public portfolio but would need to be added for a multi-user application.

Rate Limiting: No rate limiting is currently implemented.

Free Tier Performance: The application is deployed on Render's free tier. Services may "spin down" after a period of inactivity, causing a delay of up to 30 seconds on the first request.
